    <h2>What is a Vision Board?</h2>

    <p>
      "A vision board is a collage of
      <strong>
        images, words, and affirmations that represent a person's goals, dreams,
        and aspirations.
      </strong>
      It serves as a visual tool for motivation and inspiration, helping to keep
      your intentions top of mind and focus your actions. Vision boards can be
      physical, made on a poster board or in a notebook, or digital."
